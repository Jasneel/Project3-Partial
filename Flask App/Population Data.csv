3,"Since this statistical activity is a census and all non-response has been imputed, the sampling error is zero (0) which give a CV of zero (0). To take into account that imputation has occurred, both the sampling error (which is 0 for every estimate) and the non-response rate are combined into one quality rating code for each estimate. This code uses letters that range from A to E where A means the estimate is of excellent quality and E means it is to be used with caution. A: excellent data quality (CV is 0 and non-response rate is 10% or lower), B: very good data quality (CV is 0 and non-response rate is 10.01% to 33%), C: good data quality (CV is 0 and non-response rate is 33.01% to 60%), E: use with caution (CV is 0 and non-response rate is greater than 60%).",,,,
